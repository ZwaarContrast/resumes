## About
Hi! I'm Danny, a senior Software Engineer with over a decade of experience in the industry, specializing in NodeJS, TypeScript, Serverless and AWS Web Services. I am a problem-solver at heart, always thinking outside of the box to find creative and cost-effective ways to tackle complex challenges.

When I am not working, I can be found enjoying the great outdoors, hiking in the dunes, fields, forests and mountains of this world. Besides being a nerd on the code-front, I am also a passionate amateur historian with a specific focus on investigating my hometown of Katwijk during the Second World War.
